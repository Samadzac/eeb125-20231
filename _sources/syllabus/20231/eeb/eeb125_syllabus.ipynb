    "## Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Life and physical scientists increasingly use big and complex datasets to answer questions about society and the natural world. In this course, students will develop introductory programming knowledge and data acumen to explore topics drawn from biology, chemistry, physics, and psychology. Students will learn to create and run computer programs, organize ideas using data to communicate clearly to others, break a complex problem into simpler parts, apply general data science principles to specific cases, distinguish causation from correlation and coincidence, and negotiate tradeoffs between different computational and statistical approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write computer programs in Python to prepare data for statistical analyses and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write computer programs in Python to conduct a variety of statistical analyses using Python and provide an oral and written interpretation of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify appropriate uses of computational and statistical methods to answer scientific questions, including their strengths and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clearly communicate the results of a data analysis to both technical and non-technical audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall purpose of the labs is for you to gain experience using python in a Jupyter notebook to compute and visualize data under the guidance of a teaching assistant.  During most labs you will be given a small assessment that will usually involve using python to complete by the end of the lab.  Labs are not optional and you may be asked to prepare for labs, although TAs will not be taking attendance, but you will typically be required to submit an assessment at the end of each lab. \n",

    "### Weekly Lab and Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "Each week (except the week of the midterm and final week of class), you will attend your lab section and work on completing assigned homework for the week.\n",
    "There will be 10 labs and homeworks in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lab, you'll be able to work with your classmates and your TA to practice and apply the knowledge and skills introduced in that week's lecture.\n",
    "Some labs will also help you build your oral and written communication skills, to help you prepare for your final project.\n",
    "You will be graded in the labs on your participation only---your TA will be looking for you to make a good faith effort to show up each week, work on the assigned tasks, and engage with your classmates and ask questions if you get stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll then have additional time after the lab to complete your assigned homework, and submit it by Tuesday at 11:50pm the following week.\n",
    "Your submitted homework will be graded both by TAs and by automated tests to check the correctness of your code.\n",
    "More details will follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: to give you flexibility throughout the semester, your two lowest lab grades and two lowest homework grades will be dropped. This includes dropping grades of 0 when you do not attend a lab or submit a weekly homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Midterm Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The midterm test will be held *online*, during regular class time.\n",
    "More details about the midterm will be posted closer to the date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The final project will involve students using data science methodologies to explore a scientific question, and communicate the results.  A draft proposal of your plan will be due on March 20 at 23:59 and the final project will be due on April 10.  One of the goals of the draft proposal is to give you feedback that can be incorporated into your final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Exam/Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "The final exam format will be either in-person and scheduled by the Faculty of Arts and Science or an online final assessment. The format will be communicated closer to the test date. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Missed Assessments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weekly Lab and Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "Late lab or weekly homework assignments will not be accepted for any reason, since we plan to post answers soon after the due date.  If you do not submit a lab or homework by the deadline then your grade on will be 0.  NB: the two lowest lab and homework will be excluded when calculating your final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Midterm Test\n",
    "\n",
    "If you miss the midterm for any reason then you will have an opportunity to write a makeup midterm sometime during the same week (i.e., before February 18). If you miss both the scheduled midterm and the makeup midterm then you will receive a 0 for the midterm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Late project proposals and late final projects will be accepted, but there will be a penalty of 20% for each 24 hour period. For example, if the proposal is submitted on March 21 at 00:01 then 20% will be deducted, and if it's submitted March 22 then 20% will be deducted from your project proposal grade.  If you submit a late proposal then the teaching team cannot guarantee feedback in a timely fashion which means that you may have less time to incorporate your feedback into your final submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Exam/Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "If the final exam is in-person and scheduled by the faculty and you miss the final exam then you should contact your college registrar.  If the final assessment is scheduled by the teaching team and you miss this assessment for any reason then you will be given one opportunity complete a makeup assessment scheduled during the final assessment period. If you do not complete the final assessment then your grade for the final assessment will be 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no need to install any software on your own computer.  All the software for the course can be accessed via any computer with a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.).  We will be using the [University of Toronto Jupyterhub](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca) for computing.  In this course most of the data science computational work will be done using the [python programming language](https://www.python.org) in a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org). The teaching team will be able available to help guide students in using Python and Jupyter notebooks on the UofT Jupyterhub.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to install python and Jupyter on your own computer. But, if you decide to use it to complete course assessments, and **you encounter problems using python and Jupyter to complete a course assessment on your own computer, then we will not be able to provide support**.  In particular this will not be a valid excuse that your homework was submitted after it's due date.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "Any requests to have an assessment remarked must contain a written justification for consideration. Marking requests should be made within one week of receiving your assessment. *Please note* that we reserve the right to reconsider the marking of every question on your assessment when you re-submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Communicate With Your Instructors\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions about course material or organization, such as,\n",
    "\n",
    "- What do I change the colour of my plotting symbol?\n",
    "- How do I do question 3?\n",
    "- When is the term test?\n",
    "\n",
    "should be posted on the discussion forum or asked in person. Questions can be posted anonymously (so that the author is anonymous to other students but not to the instructors), if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your communication is private, such as, I missed the test because I was ill, then e-mail your instructor. If you missed a lab then e-mail your TA. Use your utoronto.ca e-mail account to ensure that your message doesn’t automatically go to a Junk folder and include your full name and student number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Academic Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "You are responsible for knowing the content of the [University of Toronto’s Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters](http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, we encourage you to discuss course material with each other and ask others for advice. However, it is not permitted to share complete solutions or to directly share code for anything that is to be handed in. When an assignment is required to be completed as a team, you may share solutions and code with other members of your team, but not with another team in the class. For example, “For question 2 what Python function did you use?” is a fair question; “Please show me your Python code for question 2” is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions about what is or is not permitted in this course, please do not hesitate to contact your instructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessibility Needs\n",
    "\n",
    "The University of Toronto is committed to accessibility. If you require accommodations for a disability, or have any accessibility concerns about the course, the class room, or course materials, please contact Accessibility Services as soon as possible: <mailto:accessibility.services@utoronto.ca> or <https://accessibility.utoronto.ca>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Responsibilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is designed to actively engage you in the course material. We hope you’ll find this course on computation and data science interesting, challenging, and fun. In order for classroom sessions and labs to be effective, prepare by learning about the weeks concepts through completing the recommended problems and readings.\n"
